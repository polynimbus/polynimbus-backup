## Overview

Polynimbus Backup is a subproject of Polynimbus, multi-cloud infrastructure inventory
and management tool. Backup subproject is a simple solution, that maintains a local
copies of all cloud object storage buckets (AWS S3 for now), using configuration
profiles generated by core Polynimbus.

Separation between core Polynimbus and Polynimbus Backup is designed to allow
installing core Polynimbus on your core server, with highly restricted access,
where the machine itself can be very small - while Polynimbus Backup needs
a lot of RAM and disk space.
